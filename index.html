    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: February 20, 2026</p>

    <p>Usama Patente ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information in our driving exam preparation app.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We believe in data minimization. Usama Patente is designed to function with minimal personal data. We do not collect names, addresses, or phone numbers unless you voluntarily provide them via support email.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app is built using Flutter. We may use standard platform services (like Apple Intelligence or iCloud) which are governed by Apple’s own privacy policies. We do not sell your data to third-party advertisers.</p>

    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Usama Patente is intended for individuals preparing for driving exams (typically ages 16+). We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights & Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>In accordance with 2026 App Store guidelines, you have the right to access or delete any data we may have. Since we do not use accounts, your progress is typically stored locally on your device. To clear all data, simply delete the app.</p>
